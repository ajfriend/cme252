# CME 252 Course website

Course website for [CME 252: Introduction to Optimization](http://ajfriend.github.io/cme252/).

Made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/). Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Jekyll sites don't seem to work out of the box with GitHub "Project Site" pages. [Modifying some of the paths](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project-page-url-structure) gets things working.
