## Course Description

This course introduces mathematical optimization and modeling, with a focus on convex optimization. Topics include: varieties of mathematical optimization, convexity of functions and sets, convex optimization modeling with CVXPY, gradient descent and basic distributed optimization, in-depth examples from machine learning, statistics and other fields and applications of bi-convexity and non-convex gradient descent.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with linear algebra, differential multivariable calculus, and basic probability and statistics. Experience with Python will be helpful, but not required.
